## Problem statement 
Farmers are facing problems in cultivating of crops. Some crops may fail and farmers will not receive the outcome they expects.Majorly farmers face this problem.To overcome this, we have constructed a machine learning model that helps farmers to pick better crop that satisfies their needs in that season.
## About the project
Our project uses Machine learning model for predicting crop yield. It predicts about crop yield and it helps farmers to pick better crop

## Technical implemntaion 
Our approach of the project is 
- Data collection
- Data preprocessing
- Deploying machine learning model
- Evaluating the results

## Techstacks used 
 `ml` , `colab` 

## How to run locally 
Steps to run your project locally:
- step 1 : clone the repo 
- step 2 : Use cd command
- step 3 : install libraries like numpy,pandas,scikit-learn
- step 4 : Run the file


# What's next ?
Creating a website for the users and deploy machine learning model in it.
